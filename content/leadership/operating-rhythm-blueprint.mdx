An operating rhythm is the calm heartbeat of a leadership team. Mine starts with a **focus week** every quarter—one page describing the bets, risks, and non-negotiables. From there we keep three lightweight loops:

- **Monday maps.** Every VP updates a shared canvas with outcomes, blockers, and asks. We end the call with a single story that captures customer impact.
- **Midweek measures.** Finance and product co-pilot an async review of five numbers that matter. If a metric needs discussion, it becomes a three-person huddle—not an all-hands debate.
- **Friday reflections.** 15 minutes to write what we learned, who we celebrated, and where we felt drag.

The documentation is boring on purpose. Boring creates flow. Flow frees energy for the work only leaders can do.
