Every Atlas Homestays stay follows the same simple storyline:

1. **Discovery.** We send a single, searchable guide with neighborhood stories, Wi-Fi speeds, and founder notes. Prospects convert because we answer their questions without asking them to dig.
2. **Booking.** The confirmation email doubles as an onboarding playbook. Guests know how to enter, who to text, and what to expect from the welcome gift.
3. **Arrival.** Hosts get a 30-minute readiness checklist: fragrance, playlist, lighting, and smart lock diagnostics.
4. **Follow-up.** Forty-eight hours after checkout we ask one question—“Where did we surprise you?”—then we turn the answer into our next play.

It’s a loop because every guest teaches us something that improves the next arrival. The system is calm, the stays feel personal, and operators can scale without burning out.
