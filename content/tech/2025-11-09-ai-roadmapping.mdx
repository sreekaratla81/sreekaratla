The AI hype cycle will punish teams that ship proofs of concept without a credible path to production. This playbook comes from
guiding global enterprises across that gap.

## Ground the AI conversation in systems reality

Every AI roadmapping session begins with the inventory. Document the systems of record, the integration bottlenecks, and the ent
ropic data definitions that undo otherwise brilliant ideas. Without this baseline, AI ideas become slideware.

## Sequence outcomes, not models

Executives ask for copilots. Architects ask for reference implementations. Operators ask for automation. The roadmap has to hono
r all three by sequencing outcomes rather than technical milestones.

n use cases.
