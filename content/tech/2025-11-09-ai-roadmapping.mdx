<Callout type="info">
The AI hype cycle will punish teams that ship proofs of concept without a credible path to production. This playbook comes from
guiding global enterprises across that gap.

## Ground the AI conversation in systems reality

Every AI roadmapping session begins with the inventory. Document the systems of record, the integration bottlenecks, and the entropic data definitions that undo otherwise brilliant ideas. Without this baseline, AI ideas become slideware.

## Sequence outcomes, not models

Executives ask for copilots. Architects ask for reference implementations. Operators ask for automation. The roadmap has to honor all three by sequencing outcomes rather than technical milestones.

A credible roadmap starts with the smallest behavior change that creates trust between humans and machine intelligence.

## Invest in the operating system of AI delivery

Great roadmaps account for compliance, observability, and the habit of continuous learning. This is why every AI initiative needs a telemetry spine from day one.

<Callout type="success">
The enterprises that succeed with AI treat the roadmap as a living artifact, updated every quarter with telemetry from production use cases.
