Building an enterprise AI capability is less about chasing models and more about *reliability*. The leaders I work with want a clear runway from business intent to trusted deployment.

<Callout>
Ship the first workflow quickly, but plot your next five. Momentum gives you time to harden the platform.

I anchor AI programs around three loops:

1. **Intake and triage.** Product partners submit use-cases with a short, opinionated brief so that data, security, and UX can react together.
2. **Model factories.** Patterns for prompt engineering, feature pipelines, and evaluation that keep humans-in-the-loop visible.
3. **Run-time observability.** Events, cost telemetry, and feedback surfaces connect back to the teams that can respond in minutes—not weeks.

The platform team’s real job is choreography. When you build the connective tissue, every new experiment inherits the same guardrails. That’s how you earn executive trust.
