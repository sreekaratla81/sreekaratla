## Begin where the nervous system relaxes

Executives ask for presence as if it were a widget. The nervous system is the real dashboard. I start every coaching session by
inviting leaders to notice the sensations at the base of the spine.

## A triad practice for seekers-becoming-leaders

1. **Stillness** — 10 minutes of open awareness before any device is unlocked.
2. **Service** — Send one message of gratitude to a teammate or guest.
3. **Strategy** — Write the single decision that would make the day meaningful.

der.

Leadership resilience depends on completion. I end each evening with a conscious close: breathe, review the day, celebrate one m
oment of alignment, and release unmet expectations into a journal.
