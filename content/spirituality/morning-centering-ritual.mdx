Leadership fatigue often comes from decision residue—the conversations you never closed. This ritual clears the slate before the calendar starts.

1. **Breath scan (3 minutes).** Four-count inhale, six-count exhale. Feel the breath settle just below the navel.
2. **Gratitude ledger (3 minutes).** Write three micro-moments from the last 24 hours. Focus on people, not outcomes.
3. **Intent mantra (3 minutes).** Whisper a line that sets your leadership posture: *"I lead with steadiness and curiosity."*
4. **Preview (3 minutes).** Visualize the first meeting of the day. Picture the energy you want the room to absorb.

Capture any insights in a pocket notebook. Close with a sip of warm water. Then go build.
